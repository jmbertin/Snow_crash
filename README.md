# Snow_crash

Welcome to the Snow crash project! This project is one of the security course at 42 School. Snow crash is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where you will find vulnerabilities in code and exploit them to progress to the next level.

## Project Overview
There are a total of 10 mandatory levels and 5 bonus levels. Each level contains a vulnerability, and your goal is to exploit it in order to retrieve the flag. This flag will be your key to the next level.

Below are the links to the directories for each level:

[Level00](./level00/walkthrough.md) - Permissions & Crypto

[Level01](./level01/walkthrough.md) - Passwd & Crypto

[Level02](./level02/walkthrough.md) - Network packet analyze

[Level03](./level03/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering BIN

[Level04](./level04/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering Perl

[Level05](./level05/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering SH script

[Level06](./level06/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering PHP

[Level07](./level07/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering BIN

[Level08](./level08/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering BIN / LN

[Level09](./level09/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering BIN / Crypto

[Level10](./level10/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering BIN / Race condition

[Level11](./level11/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering Lua

[Level12](./level12/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering Perl

[Level13](./level13/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering BIN / Crypto

[Level14](./level14/walkthrough.md) - Reverse engineering BIN / Crypto

## What's Inside Each Level?
In every directory, you'll find the following files:

- walkthrough.md: An explanation of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.
- flag: The flag you'll get after exploiting the vulnerability.

In some directories you could find some tools / scripts, in ressources folder, used to exploit the binary of the level.

----

## Getting Started
Start with Level00 and read the walkthrough.md to understand the nature of the vulnerability.
Use your knowledge and skills to exploit the vulnerability and retrieve the flag from the code.
Use the retrieved flag to gain access to the next level.
Remember, the goal is to understand the vulnerabilities and learn how to prevent them in the future. Good luck and happy hacking!
